Simplicissimus 0.1 released!

With pleasure I announce the release of Simplicissimus 0.1,
the essential blogging system. In a world of content
management systems with bells and whistles, it seeks
simplicity, where less is more.

<i>Overview</i>

Simplicissimus is a bare-bones blogging system that uses
plain text files to store blog entries. You can also add
additional pages in PHP or HTML.  

<i>Blog entries</i>

Blog entries are simple text files, stored in the file
hierarchy "entires/$year/$month/$day/" within the main
folder of Simplicissimus. You can create and edit your
files directly on the server, or update them through
FTP or SCP. Only entries with the ending <i>.txt</i> will be
shown. Use other endings for storing your drafts.

<i>Separate pages</i>

Store separate pages as <i>.php</i> files in the folder "pages".
To promote a tidy file hierarchy, each extra page has a
name, is stored with all its additional content in "pages/$name",
and can be accessed through the file "pages/$name/$name.php".
These pages will be displayed within the Simplicissimus framework,
and automatically added to the blog menu.

<i>Settings</i>

The following parameters are available for easy modification
at the beginning of the Simplicissimus file: blog title,
sub-title, entries per page, theme name.

<i>Content structure</i>

Description of content and appearance is neatly separated,
and can be modified through CSS. Simplicissimus automatically
adds div tags to blog entries, working by paragraphs that are
separated by a blank line. The first paragraph is regarded as
the title, the second as the lead-in, and the following ones
as the remaining paragraphs. The date is automatically added
to blog entries. Note that HTML elements and tags can be used.

<i>Themes</i>

A theme is stored in "themes/$themename", and must provide the
file "themes/$themename/style.css".

<i>Technical requirements</i>

Requirements are very low: PHP4, chmod 755 for directories,
and chmod 544 for files. Theming is achieved through CSS
(optional); the default theme only requires a rudimentary
CSS2 support (works even with IE6).

<i>Other features</i>

The following features are out of scope for Simplicissimus:
user accounts; content management through browser; reader
comments; search; tags; syndication. The three latter though
can be implemented as pages, if necessary.

That's all there is, nothing more, and nothing less.
Other features than these will hardly be pursued, besides
reader commenting perhaps and syndication.

By the way, I do realize that the wheel is tired of being
reinvented, but as a matter of fact after quite some search
I didn't find a blogging system that met my needs.

I hope you enjoy this software! If you have any suggestions,
comments, or ideas about the software, feel free to send me
an email. I'd be happy to hear from you.

Cheers, Benjamin.
